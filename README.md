# new-highs

This program scrapes the Sydney Morning Herald website to get the list
of shares that are making new 52 week highs. 

It stores the list of shares when run each day in a file and reports
on how many times since starting the file a share has made a new 52 
week high. The purpose is to track over the week which shares are making
multiple new highs, and therefore likely to be forming a strong trend.
